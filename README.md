# QuEra Sample Submission Scripts

This repo provides some examples of running bloqade and also submitting jobs to QuEra's Aquila analogue quantum computer and retrieving results from their dashboard for post-processing. 

The repository contains several examples showing what can be run using the python bloqade interface and what can be reasonably run on the actual hardware. 

## Requirements

* Bloqade : `python -m venv py-aquila; source py-aquila/bin/activate; pip install bloqade`
